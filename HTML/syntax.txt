    <!-- It's simple to add images using 'img' with an internal caption 'alt' -->
    <!-- <img src = "URL" alt = "A caption goes here"> -->
    <!-- 
        Adding hyperlinks is simple, too! The Anchor Text is like a replacement
        for the url
        <a href = "URL"> This anchor test need not be in quotes</a>

        - The things that look like variables (i.e. href, alt, src) are called "Attributes"
        - Editing attributes is done within the first < > tags
            * <footer id = value> Footer Text </footer>
        - target = "_blank" opens up a new tab when using hyperlinks
        - If you don't know where your href will go to, you can add a dead link
        using the '#' symbol as the URL
        - You can nest things and create images that are hyperlinks
            * <a href = "#"> 
                <img src = URL alt = Text>
              </a>

        - So unordered lists <ul> and <ol> create bullet-point styled lists
            * Use <li> </li> for each item
            * li = list item
            * ul = unordered list
            * ol = ordered list

        - For specified types of inputs
            * radio for circles
            * checkbox for -- well -- checkboxes

        - If you want people to type shit in, you need an <input> element
            * <input type = "text">
            * put in the "required" flag to make the input un-skippable
            * If you want some text to already be within the input box,
              use the placeholder="text" attribute

        - <form> can submit webform data to servers
            * Nest an <input> if you'd like to type in the form
        
        - <button type="submit"> will create a neat little button to click on
        - Line breaks in HTML are: <br>
        - To create markable inputs, the input type is "radio"

        - Form submissions send the "value" attribute over to the server
            * The default is "on," but this is largely inspecific and useless
            * Custom values are denoted by "value=stuff"
        - To leave radio/checked buttons on by default, use the keyword "checked"
        at the end of the tag

        - Labels accompany only ONE <input> element
            * It's good practice to match their <label for="name"> with the name
            of the input

        - <div> </div> are general purpose dividers to split messy ass code up
            * You can think of them like namespaces without the specificity
            * <head> and <body> are other containers
                - <head> takes markup about the page: links, title, meta, style, etc.
                - <body> takes stuff about the content: <p> <a> 

        - <!DOCTYPE html> must start the file
        - All html code is to go into <html> </html> tags
